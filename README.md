# Muehle-Spiel

## To-Do

* Implement phase 2 and 3

* Figure out how to deploy properly

## Issues

* detectMuehle[1] may be unneccessary bc I don't think it is ever used

* mill/Muehle?

* Crashes for unknown reasons

* No delay before AI makes a move -> feels weird, especially when it removes a piece you just placed

## Additional features

* Let AI make the first move

* Timer (how long has this game been going)

* Save permanent stats such as Games won, Games lost, etc.
